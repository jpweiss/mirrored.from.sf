Special 'mrtg-dslmodem.pl' Options:
-----------------------------------

--keep-in-foreground

    Unlike the '-n' option, '--keep-in-foreground' behaves exactly the
    same as '-d', but without daemonizing the process.

--l2t

    def
    def

--recover2mrtg

    def
    def

Envvar:  $VERBOSE

    Does just one thing:  If set, prints out the name of the configuration
    file created using the '-c' option.


==============================================================================

To Modify 'mrtg-dslmodem.pl':
-----------------------------

1. Update the value of '$c_VersionVal', if you haven't done so
   already.

2. Search for the variable, '$c_ExpectedVal'.
   - Copy its value to the clipboard ... including the trailing space.

3. Run the new, modified version of 'mrtg-dslmodem.pl' as follows:
       $PWD/mrtg-dslmodem.pl -c nuVer -p
   - You need to run it with an absolute-path.
   - You don't need to worry whether or not it has a configuration
     file.
   - You do, however, need to have a writable 'etc' subdirectory
     in whatever directory 'mrtg-dslmodem.pl' resides.

4. Paste the previously-copied value of '$c_ExpectedVal' onto the
   commandline and hit return.

5. Repeat #4.

6. Retrieve the value of the 'passwd' variable that was appended to
   the configuration file.

7. Replace the value of '$c_VerifyVal' with the string you got in step
   #6.
   - Split and line-wrap the string at column-76 [i.e. the "'." at the
     end of the line will be in columns 76 & 77].

8. Rerun this new script to update all of your passwords.
