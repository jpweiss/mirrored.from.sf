- The Big One:

  Finish 'debUtils.pm'

  Since I'm not using a debian-based distro at the moment, I'm kinda
  flying blind here.  The only bit of info I've got is this:
  * "admindir=/var/lib/dpkg", but can be set from the commandline of
    "dpkg".
  * Files in the "admindir" seem to contain the list of package member
    files.
  * Package install time is... where?  I haven't found out yet...

- "install.sh" does not handle cron installations without an
  /etc/cron.{weekly,monthly}.  For these installations, it would be
  very nice to add two lines to the global 'crontab' file.
  As a first-draft, I could add a sample 'crontab' file, or sample
  'crontab' entries/cmds to the documentation.

- Could also change the permission/ownership/symlink restoration
  scripts so that changes which do nothing don't execute.  Or not...

- Put together some archiver scripts that use GNU-tar's backup
  facilities, as an example of how to do a trivial backup of user
  files.
