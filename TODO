* X Error Crash
  The following error causes the program to exit(1):

    $ X Error of failed request:  BadValue 
          (integer parameter out of range for operation)
      Major opcode of failed request:  144 (XTEST)
      Minor opcode of failed request:  2 (X_XTestFakeInput)
      Value in failed request:  0x0
      Serial number of failed request:  2968
      Current serial number in output stream:  2969

  Fix it.  Or, at the very least, prevent it from crashing the program.
