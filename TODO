** Rev 2103 (jpwToolkit)
- Doxygen tweaks:
  + Escaped some sensitive characters in the doxycomments (as per the Doxygen
    manual).
  + Now generating a graphical class heirarchy, collaboration graph, and
    call/caller graph.
  + Added more doxycomments.
- ProgramOptions_Base changes:
  + C'tor is now a protected member.
  + Reorganized the members.
  + Fleshed out more doxycomments.
- New Class:  ReloadableProgramOptions_Base
  + Subclasses ProgramOptions_Base
  + The c'tor takes an additional arg, a signal, and registers a static member
    signal-handler for it.  The signal-handler toggles a "reload required"
    flag.
  + A handler member fn. checks the "reload required" flag and calls
    "reparse()" if needed.
