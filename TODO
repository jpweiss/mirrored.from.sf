* X Error Crash
  The following error causes the program to exit(1):

    $ X Error of failed request:  BadValue 
          (integer parameter out of range for operation)
      Major opcode of failed request:  144 (XTEST)
      Minor opcode of failed request:  2 (X_XTestFakeInput)
      Value in failed request:  0x0
      Serial number of failed request:  2968
      Current serial number in output stream:  2969

  Fix it.  Or, at the very least, prevent it from crashing the program.

  » Ok.  I wasn't calling XFlush when XTestFake*Event returned false.  This
    is wrong.  Fixing it seems to have helped with the error+crash.
    - »Nope.  The error still occurs.
      Trying the following:  Redirecting stdout/stderr.  See if that does the
      trick.
      + Nope.  The error still occurs.
        ° »For the moment, daemonizing appears to solve the problem...

  Alternate/Workaround:
  1. Daemonize self.
     · All signal handling has to spit out an exit value other than 1.
  2. Fork a child to perform the actual execution.
  3. Wait on the child.
  4. Re-execute if the child exits with 1.
  + Trying this from the shell, I see a lot of these errors.
