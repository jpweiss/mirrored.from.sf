* SF Commit Log:
** Rev 2103 (jpwToolkit)
- Doxygen tweaks:
  + Escaped some sensitive characters in the doxycomments (as per the Doxygen
    manual).
  + Now generating a graphical class heirarchy, collaboration graph, and
    call/caller graph.
  + Added more doxycomments.
- ProgramOptions_Base changes:
  + C'tor is now a protected member.
  + Reorganized the members.
  + Fleshed out more doxycomments.
- New Class:  ReloadableProgramOptions_Base
  + Subclasses ProgramOptions_Base
  + The c'tor takes an additional arg, a signal, and registers a static member
    signal-handler for it.  The signal-handler toggles a "reload required"
    flag.
  + A handler member fn. checks the "reload required" flag and calls
    "reparse()" if needed.
** Rev 2104
- Fine-tuning some of the Doxygen settings.
- New Feature:  Configfile Reload on SIGUSR1
  + Updated src to use ReloadableProgramOptions_Base
  + Updated manpage accordingly.
- Added:  Package Postinstall/Preremove Scripts
  + Will start the daemon on package install, restart on upgrade, and
    stop on removal.
  + Updated manpage accordingly.
- Bugfixes to:
  + Manpage Makefile
  + Custom Autoconf macro
- Autoconf/Automake updates.
** Rev 2107 (jpwToolkit)
- New helper class for printing out or converting a boost::any to a string.
- FIXED:  Configfile Reloading
  + Configfile parsing split out of ProgramOptions_Base::parse() into a new
    member.  ProgramOptions_Base::showConfigHelp() also changed as a result.
  + Refactor:  Member variables_map, ProgramOptions_Base::m__opts, renamed to
    m__optVals.
  + New ProgramOptions_Base for merging a
    boost::program_options::variables_map into
    ProgramOptions_Base::m__optVals.
  + reparse() moved to ReloadableProgramOptions_Base.
  + Added member fn. to ProgramOptions_Base to pretty-print
    ProgramOptions_Base::m__optVals.
** Rev 2107 (jpwToolkit)
- BUGFIX:
  + Had to add the ability to "notify" the
    boost::program_options::variables_map in parse_cfgfile().  Otherwise,
    configfile reparsing doesn't always work.
