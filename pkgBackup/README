QUICKSTART:


The "pkgBackup" suite of scripts is a Perl program for backing up
files on your system that are part of an installed RPM/DEB package,
but have since changed.

It's designed to be fully self-contained, no need for its own RPM/DEB
package.  You only need to do three things:
  1. Untar the "pkgBackup" tarball whereever you want it to live.
  2. Decide where you want the backups to live (optionally creating the
     directory).
  3. Run the script "install.sh".

That's it.  All you need to do thereafter is periodically burn the
backups to DVD/CDRW (or copy to a Zip/Jaz disk, a spare harddrive,
whatever).



==============================================================================

MORE INFO:

Do:

    man ./pkgBackup.8.gz

...to read the manpage.  It'll tell you how to run "pkgBackup"
manually.  You can also run "./rpmBackup.pl --help" or
"./debBackup.pl --help" for a more abbreviated version.


See the "TODO" file for late-breaking info about missing features.  ;)

The config-file, "pkgBackup.conf", contains documentation-comments
explaining how to use it.


PLEASE DO *NOT* use "pkgBackup" for "/home" or other user files:

- This program is designed for backing up your system customizations, not
  users' home directories.
- It's better to backup "/home" separately from the rest of the system, on a
  different schedule.
- There may be files in "/home" that don't change much (family photo scans,
  USENET news articles you like, your MP3 collection, Quicktime movies,
  porn, custom *.rpm/*.deb packages) but you're leaving on-disk for
  convenience.  You (should) burn these files to CD-R not long after
  download, or when you have enough collected.
  Clearly, you're not interested in backing up these files on a regular
  basis; there's no need.

For the files in "/home" that *do* change frequently, I suggest using one of
the standard backup tools (taper, kdat, tar) and archiving to a file.

DEVELOPING IT FURTHER:

I haven't tested "rpmBackup.pl" against new versions of "rpm" since
2008.  If you use a RedHat- or Fedora-based system and want to perform
any needed updates, have a look at "rpmUtils.pm" [which is where any
calls to the "rpm" binary take place].
