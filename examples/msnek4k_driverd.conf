# msnek4k_driverd - Configuration File:
# 
# Settings in the configuration file are of the form:
# 
#     settingName=value
# 
# Multiple settings can be grouped into sections.  Each option in a group
# has the form "sectionName.settingName", and appears in the configuration 
# file as follows:
# 
#     [sectionName]
#     settingName=value
# 
# The comment delimiter is '#' and may appear anywhere on a line.
# 
# 
#   display arg  The X11 display to run on.  Overrides the DISPLAY 
#                environment variable.
#                This option is required if DISPLAY is not set.
# 
# 
#   kbd-dev arg (=auto) The full pathname of the keyboard device, or 
#                       the special string, "auto".  The latter 
#                       triggers autoscanning for the keyboard.
#   Zoom.isMouseButton  Equivalent to setting both the "ZoomUp.isMouse
#                       Button" and "ZoomDown.isMouseButton" configura

#                       on file variables.  Ignored if "Zoom.isMouseBu
#                       tton" isn't also set to true.
# 
#   logfile arg (=/tmp/msnek4k_driverd.log) The name of the log file. 
#                                           Ignored if "--dbg" is 
#                                           passed on the commandline.

# Details:
#   
#   * Selecting a "--kbd-dev <dev>":
#                         
#     In the event that autoscanning fails to find the keyboard device 
#     ... or it finds the wrong device ... you will have to set the 
#     "kbd-dev" option manually.
#     Usually, <dev> will be under "/dev/input" or "/dev/input/by-id". 
#     To determine which one to use:
#     1. Run 'input-events <n>', replacing "<n>" with an integer 
#        corresponding to an "event*" file in "/dev/input".
#     2. Move the 'Zoom' key on your keyboard.  If you get no response,
#        repeat step-1 with a different value of "<n>".  Otherwise, the file
#        "/dev/input/event<n>" (where "<n>"is the integer you used in 
#        step-1) is the device you want.
#                         
#   
#   * The "ZoomUp.isMouseWheel", and "ZoomDown.isMouseWheel" Settings:
#                         
#     Normally, holding down a mouse button generates a single event.  
#     Releasing it generates another, separate event.  Under X11, a mouse
#     wheel is mapped to two buttons, one for each wheel direction.  The 
#     mouse wheel itself produces a button-click (or so it appears to 
#     X11).
#     If you want to use the Zoom jog as a mouse wheel, this becomes a 
#     problem.  Suppose you've set "ZoomUp.isMouseWheel", and 
#     "ZoomDown.isMouseWheel" to true.  Holding the Zoom jog up or down 
#     produces the same event as holding _down_ a mouse button, which is 
#     the same as moving the mouse wheel _once_.
#                         
#     The main reason for mapping the Zoom jog to the mouse wheel 
#     buttons, however, is to use it as an auto-rolling mouse wheel.
#                         
#     Setting "ZoomUp.isMouseWheel" and "ZoomDown.isMouseWheel" to true
#     causes holding the Zoom jog to click the mouse wheel button, just 
#     like an actual mouse wheel does.  Releasing the Zoom jog will be 
#     ignored.  So, holding the Zoom jog will act as if you're spinning 
#     the mouse wheel nonstop.
#                         
#     Remember:  Each of these settings are ignored if the 
#     corresponding "Zoom*.isMouseButton" isn't set to true.
#                         
#   
#   * The "Spell.x11Keycode", "ZoomUp.x11Keycode", and 
#     "ZoomDown.x11Keycode" Settings:
#                         
#     Note that these are not keySYMs, but keyCODEs.  X11 maps the raw 
#     keyboard scancodes to its own set of 8-bit codes.  These are the 
#     X11 keycodes.
#                         
#     You should choose a keycode (between 1 and 255) that isn't 
#     already in use by X11.  (You *could* use the same keycode as 
#     another key, causing this key to behave identical to that other 
#     key.  But then, why map it at all?)  To find unused keycodes, run 
#     the following from a terminal:
#                         
#         xmodmap -pke | grep ' = *$' | less
#                         
#     (Picking one of the higher unused keycodes should insulate you 
#     from future XFree86/Xorg or kernel changes.)
#                         
#     Note:  Using this driver will not automagically map the Spell & 
#            Zoom keys to a keysym for you.  You'll need to do that, yourself, 
#            using the "xmodmap" utility.
#                         
#
