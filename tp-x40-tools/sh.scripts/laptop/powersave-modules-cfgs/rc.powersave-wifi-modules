# Turn off wifi to save power
# [2011/05] Note:  Don't remove 'libipw' or 'lib80211', since doing that 
#           seems to cause the v2.6.35 kernel headaches.
##ipw2200 libipw lib80211

# [2011/05] Removing these two seems to cause the v2.6.38 kernel to get
#           confused and think that it no longer has any encryption.
##lib80211_crypt_ccmp lib80211_crypt_tkip lib80211_crypt_wep

# Prune the cryptographic modules used by the wifi.
# [jpw; 2011/05] No, leave them.  I'm having trouble connecting due
#                to an invalid password, and it's a crypto-level failure.
